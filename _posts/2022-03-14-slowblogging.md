I realized that my search for the best blogging platform is still 
work in progress. Remembered this one, and the benefits and advantages
of having to write markdown directly. 

The main blog of mine is currently in Wordpress and have even got accustomed
to its "new" editing interface. After some initial hurdles, the "block" editing
style is quite nice.

Then I had an old Tumlbr-blog, which seem to be more mobile friendly, not sure
if that could be used to something, but have to experiment. 

Learnt from this one, that even code in version control requires running 
occasionally. The modules get old, and basically did whole version update thing
via starting whole thing again, to get development environment sorted out. 

But let's see.
