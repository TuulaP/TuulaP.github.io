This summer there are couple of interesting challenges.
During July the [#30daysofTesting challenge](http://www.ministryoftesting.com/2016/06/30-day-testing-challenge/) started.
In addition, the Helsinki area libraries are having a [reading challenge](http://www.helmet.fi/en-US/Events_and_tips/News_flash/Helmet_reading_challenge_2016\(80416\)) (altough this covers whole year)


## Days 1-3 of Testing

*Day 1. (Book)* Started reading 'Showing up' from Leanpub

*Day 2. (Photo)* Tricky.

Just recently I was in conference where I took lots of images, but maybe better is the report I'm starting with:

![Area diagram demo]({{site.url}}/imgs/areadiag.png "Desired outcome of area diagram")


This is the final result, which I would like to have, but not yet run this against with my data, which might still require some cleaning up.

*Day 3. (Podcast)* Searched for a [testing-related new podcast](http://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/?feed=rss2)  and currently listening it.
It is funny that I've some life, management, technology related pocast in my listening list, but haven't searched/found one from testing side.
One book at some point had too low-volume audio, so maybe that has caused some kind of tiny 'horns effect', which I haven't got past yet :)




## Helmet Reading-challenge situation overview

Have so far read books which cover 3, 6, 8, 9, 16, 18, 19, 21, 25, 35, 41, 48
(at least) .

It would be interesting to analyze if there are books, which cover several
of the challenges. Definitely the Nobel winner one is something interesting,
my long-term goal is to read something from all of the Nobel winners.
Also especially those recommendations, which require that author is from
specific continent require bit of sorting out before
